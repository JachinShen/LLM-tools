# Accounting Tool

This tool utilizes Large Language Models (LLM) to translate natural language descriptions into accounting entries, which are then displayed in an Excel format. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the accounting system.

## Usage

To run the tool, execute the following command:

```bash
python accounting.py
```

This will launch a Gradio web interface where you can input events and view the corresponding accounting journal entries.
